We use it to grow crops for food and clothing/fibers. We use it to drink and bathe. We use water in industrial and manufacturing settings. And in many areas, it is used to cool thermoelectric power plants. In the Virtual Tour on Water Use and Conservation, you explored how people across the globe use water and some ways to conserve water.\n\nFor this discussion, we ask you to share information about your region (where you live, or where you are from originally - your choice) with others so we can learn from each other. Also, we ask you to share your suggestions for conserving water. Please respond to each question (bold, italicized) below.\n\nPart 1 (14 Points)\n\n* In what region do you live (or are you from originally)? - 3 points\n\n* Please be somewhat specific. For example, your instructor lives in Phoenix, AZ, which is located in the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern region of the United States. It is a hot, dry climate.\n\n* What does water mean to you? How do you use it? - 3 points\n\n* For example, if you are a farmer, you may need water to irrigate your crops. If you live in Phoenix, AZ, water sports such as swimming pools are an important way for people to enjoy the outdoors. Finally, some cultures view water as a spiritual object.\n\n* What water issues and solutions are in your region? Describe at least one issue and one proposed solution. - 8 points\n\n* For example, the Sonoran Desert is experiencing a 1200-year drought. As a result, there are water shortages and some people (farmers in the case of Arizona) are not able to access all of the water they could in the past. Some farmers are not able to grow crops and risk losing their farmland. One solution is to limit types of public use of water - such as not allowing water use for irrigating grass or golf courses.\n\n* You can learn more about drought issues in your region on the [National Integrated Drought Information System] (https://www.drought.gov/international) page (just as one example resource). Or perhaps you are experiencing floods or water quality (i.e., contaminated water) issues? [Or visit the United Nation's water quality page.] (https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/quality.shtml#:~:text=Globally,%20the%20most%20prevalent%20water,impairs%20beneficial%20uses%20of%20water.)\n\nPart 2 (10 points) \n\n* What are ways you could reduce your water usage? List and describe at least three strategies and how you will implement them!\n\n*\n\n* This resource from your virtual tour may help you come up with some ideas: [Water Footprint Calculator] (https://www.watercalculator.org/how-to-save-water/). If this site is not working for you, try this [website from the state of Arizona] (https://wateruseitwisely.com/100-ways-to-conserve-water/) with tips for conserving water and [this website from Florida] (https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/conservation/water-use-calculator) to estimate where you use the most water.\n\nPart 3: Respond to at least 2 of your classmates! (6 points) \n\n* You may respond to your classmates about how they use water OR about one of the strategies they discussed for conserving water. This response must be at least 2 sentences long, and please be respectful of others' views!","location":null,"id":"8b557541-ea63-47b7-b0c9-1a4e31622452","status":0},{"date":"2024-02-26","summary":"In-Lesson Assignment: Soil Conservation/Land Management Practice [2024Spring-X-BIO130-ENV130-15168-15169-21217-21216]","time":"00:00","description":"Learning Objectives:\n--------------------\n\n* Explain how slopes and terraces impact soil erosion in an agricultural setting.\n\n* Describe the impact of resident plant life (forest vs. grass), and of climate (arid vs. rainforest) on erosion rates and rate of soil development.\n\nAssignment Instructions\n-----------------------\n\nAs humans, we impact soils greatly! Let's put what you've learned above into practice using this interactive feature below from the Concord Consortium. If this simulation does not load in this window, you may access it at this link: [Concord Consortium Soil Conservation/Land Management Practice Assignment] (https://lab.concord.org/embeddable.html#interactives/land-management/land-management-master.json) \n\n[Follow the instructions and note your findings in this Google sheet] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZ5eWuEItUV9wxcL7ajMcw9YhCC0_PpwYzhgaA2dZn4/edit?usp=sharing) (make a copy to fill it in online) OR you can find the same instructions below the simulation. After examining all of the scenarios, take the quiz to earn points for the exercise.\n\nInstructions (same as those in Google sheet - link posted above)\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor these simulations, click on \"Show erosion\". Also, click on \"Zoom\" in the graphs each time you run a simulation to see changes in erosion numbers better. The graph on the top shows how much soil is being eroded from the zone, and the graph on the bottom shows how much topsoil remains in that Zone.\n\nTo start a simulation, click the right pointing triangle (play button). To reset, click on the left pointing triangle button. Make sure to reset your timeline and simulation between each different scenario.\n\nTry these different scenarios (and then some of your own) and respond to the questions for each scenario. Run each scenario for about 4 years.\n\nScenario 1:\n-----------\n\n* Landscape: Hilly\n\n* Climate: Humid Continental\n\n* Management Plan: Wheat (intensive tillage) in BOTH zones\n\n* Where does the eroded topsoil end up?\n\n* Is there more topsoil in Zone 1 (top of hill) or Zone 2 (bottom of hill)? Why?\n\nScenario 2:\n-----------\n\n* Land: Terraced\n\n* Climate: Tropical Rainforest\n\n* Management Plan: Wheat (conservative tillage) in BOTH zones\n\n* (note: Zone 1 is terraced and Zone 2 is a steep slope in this simulation)\n\n*\n\n* Which zone (terraced/slope) experiences more erosion?\n\n* Which zone (terraced/sloped) ends up with more topsoil?\n\nCompare the following two scenarios (Semi-Arid and Tropical Rainforest) \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScenario 3 (don't forget to Zoom in on graphs):\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n* Landscape: Nearly Flat\n\n* Climate: Semi-Arid\n\n* Management Plan: Zone 1 = Grass, Zone 2 = Forest\n\n*\n\n* Which zone has more topsoil (forest or grass)?\n\nScenario 4 (Zoom in on graphs): \n--------------------------------\n\n* Landscape: Nearly Flat\n\n* Climate: Tropical Rainforest\n\n* Management Plan: Zone 1 = Grass, Zone 2 = Forest\n\n*\n\n* How does monthly erosion compare between zones?\n\n* In which months do you observe the most erosion taking place? How does this compare with precipitation (see monthly precipitation chart).\n\nComparing scenarios 3 & 4:\n--------------------------\n\nWhich climate has higher erosion rates? Why do you think this is?\n\nNext, take the quiz below to demonstrate your understanding of soil conservation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------","location":null,"id":"3040b35c-4b91-4e43-aedb-a6efe926baa0","status":0},{"date":"2024-02-27","summary":"Dr. Day Brown's Office Hours [2024Spring-X-BIO130-ENV130-15168-15169-21217-21216]","time":"18:00","description":null,"location":"https://asu.zoom.us/j/7474451972","id":"b929acea-e960-44bc-9d20-f85ca23e4a02","status":0},{"date":"2024-02-27","summary":"Mindful In Class Activity 2/27 [2024Spring-T-SWU250-20830]","time":"00:00","description":"This is an activity that occurs in class and your attendance and participation in this class activity will be inputted by your instructor.  If you miss a class, you do miss these points but have the option of completing extra credit (Extra credit module) which can negate points lost from missing class.  If your absence is due to a school sanctioned activity (Provide documentation), religious holiday or medical emergency, please let your instructor know so that you may work out alternative options.","location":null,"id":"efb383d8-cf90-4d11-a8bc-f7c9b6096d93","status":0},{"date":"2024-02-28","summary":"Practice for Test 2 [2024Spring-T-MAT243-13727]","time":"00:00","description":"Take this exam to practice for test 2.

The premise of the article was that practicing mindfulness is helpful in relationships. The author introduces an existentialist perspective for couples.  In other words, we can’t separate our own perception and cognitive awareness from our interpretation of others. I often struggle with taking inventory of my feelings and why I’m feeling a certain way. It can sometimes lead to depression or anger, so being more mindful of my awareness would certainly help, especially with my relationships. Overall I think this article was really insightful and interesting. Reading about the existential perspective of relationships was interesting and it is really weird to think that everyone has their own little world in their minds.\n\nAnushka Kharbanda, & Ashwani Mohan.

The premise of the article was that practicing mindfulness is helpful in relationships. The author introduces an existentialist perspective for couples.  In other words, we can’t separate our own perception and cognitive awareness from our interpretation of others. I often struggle with taking inventory of my feelings and why I’m feeling a certain way. It can sometimes lead to depression or anger, so being more mindful of my awareness would certainly help, especially with my relationships. Overall I think this article was really insightful and interesting. Reading about the existential perspective of relationships was interesting and it is really weird to think that everyone has their own little world in their minds.\n\nAnushka Kharbanda, & Ashwani Mohan.

This includes everything from a tissue to the packaging of an Amazon delivery, and everything in between, but NOT human, biological waste (that you flush down the toilet). Once you have tracked and categorized all of your waste, you will summarize your results, making observations about your waste in a typical day. Finally, you will come up with a plan to manage and reduce your waste.\n\nPlease organize your discussion post into 3 parts, as outlined below. Then, respond to 2 of your classmates. \n\nIf you want a template so that you don't forget anything, [use this Google document] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10KuqnsWll6oVg9z2yIx3prDWyaKhRGnpsNNRxNhV368/edit?usp=sharing)(make a copy, fill it in, copy/paste your text into the discussion window). After filling in the template, copy/paste your text into the discussion window so that others can easily read it. Please do not upload a text file or Word document!\n\nPart 1: Tracking My Waste (10 points)\n-------------------------------------\n\nMake a list of all of the solid waste that you generate in a day (not including personal, biological waste). Sort your waste into five categories: food, plastic, paper, metal, and other. Make sure you keep track of all waste you produce, the amount of each, and include it in a list. Be sure to include descriptors of your waste, such as the size or type. For example, instead of simply saying cardboard box, say a medium sized box used to hold two gallons of milk, or a large, 65 inch flatscreen TV box.\n\nExample\n-------\n\n* Food: 1 banana peel and 1 apple core, 4 ounces of milk and 1/4 cup cereal, 1/2 a granola bar, grape stems, 1/4 cup pasta with red sauce, 1/3 cup leftover salad, 1 cookie, 1 old and stale hamburger bun from the back of the fridge\n\n* Plastic: 1 cream cheese container (8 ounce), 1 granola bar wrapper, 1 plastic water bottle, 1 16 ounce bottle shampoo\n\n* Paper: 1 cardboard pasta box (small), 1 shipping box (medium from Amazon)\n\n* Metal: 2 cans (beans, tomato)\n\n* Other: Dead houseplant, old dog toy\n\nFor extra credit (5 extra points), you may upload a picture of all of the waste you generated in a day. You must have your name on a piece of paper or other item that is IN the picture. It cannot be superimposed over the picture.\n\nPart 2: Summary of Waste (5 points)\n-----------------------------------\n\nFirst, summarize the total amount of waste you produced, and how much of that waste was recycled vs thrown out. Discuss what category most of your waste falls into, such as \"The majority of my waste was plastic, followed by food and paper waste. Most of the paper was recycled, but the food waste went into a landfill\"\n\nPart 3: Waste Reduction Plan (9 points)\n---------------------------------------\n\nList several (3 or more) strategies that you've learned or heard about for reducing waste and/or recycling a larger portion of waste. Discuss which of these steps you are willing to take and why (or why not).\n\nPart 4: Response to Classmates (6 points)\n-----------------------------------------\n\nRespond to at least two of your classmates. Each response is worth 3 points (x2 responses).","location":null,"id":"429541fe-eaed-4215-b1b1-63b308a868ad","status":0},{"date":"2024-04-01","summary":"Lab: Solid Waste & Recycling [2024Spring-X-BIO130-ENV130-15168-15169-21217-21216]","time":"00:00","description":"This lab activity asks you examine the amount of solid waste generated globally and in different countries, and strategies for managing waste. You will earn points for this lab activity as you respond to questions embedded in the interactive lecture below.\n\n ","location":null,"id":"12965ef8-e91a-4fb2-9ab8-124cd32fddd7","status":0},{"date":"2024-04-01","summary":"Module 5 Quiz [2024Spring-X-BIO130-ENV130-15168-15169-21217-21216]","time":"00:00","description":"This quiz will cover material from the lessons and in-lesson assignments (but not lab material) from Module 5.

In this case, [check out this article] (https://www.rentcafe.com/blog/apartment-search-2/money/apartment-utilities-breakdown/) and use some \"average\" numbers for apartments...\n\n[[screenshot of the EPA Carbon Footprint Calculator page] (https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/179742/files/79509820/preview)] (https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/)\n\nPart 2: Power Profiler - Energy Sources for Your Area\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAcross the U.S., and the globe, communities rely on different blends of energy resources to generate electricity. Electricity is then consumed in your home, and in some cases by your vehicle. How is electricity generated in your community? Nationally? Use the [EPA's Power Profiler] (https://www.epa.gov/egrid/power-profiler#/) to examine the energy resources used in your area, and to compare this with national data. Make sure to click on the Renewable/Non-renewable energy button to find out what % of energy in your region comes from renewable sources, such as solar, wind, hydro or geothermal. Again, if you do not live in the U.S. or you do not know your zip code, use the code 85287 for Tempe, AZ.\n\n[[A screenshot of the EPA Power Profiler website.] (https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/179742/files/79509839/preview)] (https://www.epa.gov/egrid/power-profiler#/)\n\n \n\nAfter you have completed (or while you still have the webpages open!), take the quiz for this lab.\n\nA note about Canvas quizzes: Whenever answer choices are circles, that means there is only one choice possible. If they are squares, that means there are multiple choices possible. Some multiple answer questions may only have one correct answer. Even when the question states \"Select all that apply,\" sometimes only one correct answer may apply.

Please take the time to answer each question completely, with a thoughtful and detailed response. Number each of your answers in Parts 1 and 2 so they correspond with each question number. This makes your ideas easy for others to read. Each answer should be at least 1 complete sentence long.\n\nPart 1: Local Policies (20 points)\n\nEvery region has access to different energy resources. Iceland has an amazing geothermal grid. Texas, U.S.A. has lots of wind power. Therefore, energy plans that may be excellent for one region may be awful for another. The [renewable energy virtual tour] (https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/179742/pages/virtual-tour-renewable-energy-resources?module_item_id=12872824) has many resources to help you with Part 1 of this discussion assignment.\n\nFor this first part of the discussion, imagine that you have been elected as the mayor (elected leader) of your beautiful city. Congratulations! You will do a great job! Your first job is to describe (in at least two paragraphs) your energy plan for your city. Make sure to address the following:\n\n*\n\n* Describe where you are (town/city and state/province) and the unique attributes of your town that would factor into your decision\n\n* List the top 2 energy resources you would use to provide energy for your city (such as solar, hydropower, wind, nuclear, coal, natural gas, geothermal...).\n\n* What are the pros and cons of your plan (i.e., these resources)?\n\n* List two resources you would NOT use, and explain why you didn't select them.\n\nPart 2: National & International Policies (20 points)\n\nAs a mayor, your focus is on local energy policy. However, sometimes the strategies that work on a local scale will not work on a larger (national) scale. For example, solar energy is a great option for Phoenix, AZ but not as much in Portland, OR which is cloudy much of the winter. In Part 2, discuss whether your policies would be different on a national scale, by responding to the questions below. The [information from 7.12 Energy Public Policies (previous page)] (https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/179742/pages/energy-public-policies?module_item_id=12872825) has many resources to help you write an informed response to Part 2 of this discussion assignment.\n\n5. You mentioned two energy sources for your city in Part 1. Will these translate well to other regions in your country? Why or why not?\n\n6. Would you include nuclear energy in your plan (if on a national scale)? Why or why not?\n\n7. On a national scale, how would fossil fuels figure into your plan?\n\nPart 3: Respond to Your Classmates (10 points)\n\nRespond to (at least) 2 of your classmates about their posts and policy suggestions.\n\n* How is their local solution different from (or similar to) yours and why?\n\n* Do you agree with their ideas about using nuclear energy and/or fossil fuels on a national scale? \n\nStudent earns 5 points EACH for each response to a classmate (2 responses required). Each response must be at least 2-3 sentences long, and it must reference their classmate's response and a point that they agree or disagree with and why.","location":null,"id":"9efb7e7f-e7a7-4fa4-83b7-f9c155c1ddc4","status":0},{"date":"2024-04-22","summary":"In-Lesson Assignment: Global Energy Consumption [2024Spring-X-BIO130-ENV130-15168-15169-21217-21216]","time":"00:00","description":"Learning Objectives (continued from previous page):\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n* Examine energy production and consumption data for individual countries and globally to identify current and projected trends. \n\n* Describe which sources are being consumed (used) in large quantities, whether or not these are renewable/non-renewable sources, and how this varies by people in different countries/regions.\n\nPart 1: An Overview of Global Energy Consumption\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLook at the first interactive embedded graph (Chart 1) to answer this first set of questions:\n\n* How has global energy consumption changed since 1800? \n\n* What was the original, primary source of energy in 1800?
